          Media and technology are at the center of kids' lives every day. From a very young age,
          kids use technology at home and at school to connect with friends and family and to
          document their lives and create digital content of their own. With more and more of life
          happening online, what catches kids' attention isn't always what's best for them, and what
          companies do with their personal information isn't always clear. <br /><br />

          <p>
            For many people, movies are one of life’s greatest pleasures. You sit back with a pile
            of salty, hot popcorn, turn off the light, and dive into someone else’s universe without
            even leaving your home. For a couple of hours, you laugh and you cry. If it’s a great
            movie, by the time the lights are turned back on and the popcorn has long been
            forgotten, you walk away with an insight about yourself, the world or both. One of the
            best movie genres is movies about education. They prove what we see every day here at
            University of the People: Education can change the world.For many people, movies are one
            of life’s greatest pleasures.

              The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old dyslexic child.
              Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him
              to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps
              him to overcome his disability. Darsheel Safary stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan
              plays his art teacher.
